# Cloud Introduction and Storage

The following repo contains excercises related to the 2025-2026 Cloud introduction and storage modules of the Big Data & Cloud Master at EDEM

The folders are structured as follows:

**[cloud-intro](./cloud_intro/)**
- [local_cloud](./cloud_intro/local_cloud/): Use of VirtualBox to simulate locally IaaS and PaaS solutions so that the students get familiar with the fundamental concepts of different service models
- [end2end](./cloud_intro/end2end/): an end2end excercise to practice in class the use of a full architecture with different components that simulate what they can find in the cloud
